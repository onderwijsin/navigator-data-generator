            "text": "Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) wordt wereldwijd gezien als een toonaangevende designopleiding. Als HBO (University of Applied Sciences) met een BA- en MA-programma in design staat DAE hoog aangeschreven vanwege haar vooruitstrevende ideeën, gevestigde docenten en bekende alumni. Al ruim zeventig jaar vormen zij een internationale community van aanstormende ontwerpers opgeleid om hun stempel op de toekomst te drukken. DAE leidt haar studenten op om in die community van diverse nationaliteiten en culturen in alle vrijheid en openheid na te denken over de creatieve kracht van design. Dit helpt studenten design te begrijpen binnen een wereldwijde context. DAE vraagt haar studenten continue kritisch de status quo van design te toetsen: hoe kan design nog innovatiever worden ingezet voor vernieuwing in materiële, ethische, sociale en ecologische zin? DAE focust zich hierbij op unieke wijze op een hybride, conceptuele, contextuele en internationale benadering van design. De studenten worden hierin begeleid door divers team van internationale en professionele ontwerpers, architecten, onderzoekers, schrijvers en curatoren, die elk actief zijn binnen de academie én in het professionele werkveld"

All this results in exciting opportunities for designers. It shifts and blurs the traditional borders. It requires new ideas to make a human feel at home, show and share his identity, be comfortable and safe, and be alive. It requires new ideas to shape the public space, redefine its functions and position in the community. These developments open up new possibilities for designers, architects and other creative minds that jointly shape our living space and challenge the way we work.
