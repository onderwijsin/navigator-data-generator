How can governments in conflict-affected settings restore security, services and state legitimacy and improve inclusive development? What policies and instruments do they have to foster reconciliation and peacebuilding amongst different ethnic or religious groups and reintegrate ex-combatants? Together with international experts, you will explore the concepts of good governance and rule of law in a post-conflict setting, discuss case studies and lessons from fragile countries, and relate these to your own work context. You will learn more about the role of the different institutions – with a focus on subnational government - in restoring human security, government legitimacy and basic services. In exercises, you will increase your understanding of the influence of the political economy of conflict on state performance. Furthermore, you will increase insight in conflict analysis and conflict sensitive programming and practice with do’s and don’ts in reconciliation processes. Experts come from a.o. Transitional International, the Human Security Collective and PAX for Peace. You will learn about the multi-actor Dutch security approach and pay visits to the Peace Palace and the ICC."

Water provision and governance of water involve complex systems and the coordination of different stakeholders at all levels government. Adding to the challenge are the political and institutional contexts of the country. In many contexts, reforms for effective water management are hampered by an unclear allocation of roles and responsibilities, territorial fragmentation and limited capacity and funds at the local level. This course addresses the six building blocks of sound water governance: administrative, planning, financial, legal, stakeholder and cooperation in a balanced mix of theory, (inter)national best practices and study visit illustrating the Dutch water governance system. Participants will get a unique insight into international best practices and water governance tools and work actively to apply the building blocks for sound water governance for their own local context."
