The costs and quantities of inputs in combination with the technical results achieved and the output (milk) prices determine whether a dairy farm is commercially viable and therefore sustainable. Being a manager means being able to use the “management cycle”which will require that one can set objectives, implements activities, monitors and evaluates these activities and adjust management if objectives are not achieved. This requires precise farm recording systems which should be used to regularly monitor performance of different aspects of a dairy farm (production, fertility, calf rearing, financial). These records will also be used to calculate key performance indicators which are used for benchmarking the farm and evaluate/ analyse the performance of the dairy farm. Based on this analysis a good manager should be able to pinpoint weak spots in the dairy farm and make plans to improve these weaknesses. Choosing the right housing system has a big impact on the fixed costs of a dairy farm, the labour efficiency, animal welfare and the environment. It also requires working with standard operating procedures (sop's)"

Also young stock rearing systems determine to a large extend the quality of the dairy cow on the farm. Feeding costs usually make up often over fifty % of the variable costs on a commercial dairy farm. That is why production of good quality and enough quantity of roughage in combination with proper feeding management is the foundation for optimal technical and financial results on commercial dairy farms all over the world. During this course participants will learn how to optimize their fodder production, storage and conservation, feeding of dairy cattle and young stock rearing management taking into consideration as much as possible the conditions in which the participants have to work at home. Attention will also be given to calculation and interpretation of fodder production and feeding management performance indicators in order to monitor fodder production and feeding management including greenhouse gas emissions."

Also young stock rearing systems determine to a large extend the quality of the dairy cow on the farm. Feeding costs usually make up often over fifty % of the variable costs on a commercial dairy farm. That is why production of good quality and enough quantity of roughage in combination with proper feeding management is the foundation for optimal technical and financial results on commercial dairy farms all over the world. During this course participants will learn how to optimize their fodder production, storage and conservation, feeding of dairy cattle and young stock rearing management taking into consideration as much as possible the conditions in which the participants have to work at home. Attention will also be given to calculation and interpretation of fodder production and feeding management performance indicators in order to monitor fodder production and feeding management including greenhouse gas emissions."

Result: The primary products are well handled and stored, showing no deviations caused by handling. • Taking care of farmhouses and working environment. Result: House and equipment are cleaned and disinfected if necessary. The infection pressure is at an acceptable level. • Assessing results. Result: The farm production is efficient, both technically and economically. • Make a well motivated improvement plan. Result: The identification and analysis of farming problems as well as the creation of possible solutions lead to a practical extension plan that is well documented, organised and presented. • Linked to these topics participants develop required competences to return as a confident professional, implementing the PTC+ experience."

This requires insight in factors effecting productivity, production standards, animal behaviour, monitoring and communication with people Taking care of a poultry unit means the execution of daily, weekly and periodical care, leading to optimal production. This requires insight in the daily, weekly and periodical duties within different units, housing different types of poultry. One should understand how animal related as well as environmental factors effect productivity and should be capable of adjusting their way of working accordingly. This also implies that one should be aware of applicable production standards and using them in an appropriate way. Knowledge on animal behaviour and the ability to monitor animals is also necessary to draw conclusions on the performance of the animals and the state of their environment. Taking care of a poultry unit independently also means that one should be a discussion partner for other people involved, like managers, veterinarians, feed suppliers and consumers. Besides that, one taking care of a poultry or pig unit is not only aware of his/her responsibility towards the animals and their environment, but also of his/her responsibility regarding food quality and food safety. Linked to this, participants develop required competences to return as a confident professionals."

Both the animals as well as their environment are taking care of, in order for the animals to produce under optimal conditions. • Propose improvements for management back home based on acquired skills and knowledge. Contents • Taking care of animals. Result: The animals are in good condition, showing normal behaviour. • Handling of primary livestock products. Result: The primary products are well handled and stored, showing no deviations caused by handling. • Taking care of farmhouses and working environment. Result: House and equipment are cleaned and disinfected if necessary. The infection pressure is at an acceptable level. • Assessing results. Result: The farm production is efficient, both technically and economically. • Linked to these topics participants develop required competences to return as a confident professional, implementing the PTC+ experience."
