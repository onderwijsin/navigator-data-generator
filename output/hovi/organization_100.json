However, the degree programme also has a practical approach in its design - through project weeks, professional enquiry and a module of professional-based learning in which students complete a short work placement often linked directly to their final project. The specialisation in Digital Marketing & Communication specifically looks at the impact of the fast changing, ‘connected’ world of internet use, smart phones, apps and social media. Many companies and organisations have completely changed their approaches to advertising, and adapted their marketing strategies - not only to these new ways of communicating with customers and stakeholders, but also the actual method and perception of marketing & communication in a digital age."

Examples of companies where alumni work range from leading global companies in manufacturing and machinery to more local specialised companies in the Netherlands or elsewhere in Western Europe."
