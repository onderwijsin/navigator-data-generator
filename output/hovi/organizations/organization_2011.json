Not only the dairy tec To add value to raw milk processing technologies will be applied to come to marketable, consumable, delicious and healthy dairy products. Techniques of preservation, quality control analyses, marketing and organisation will be trained. Product groups are: pasteurised milk, fermented milk, yoghurts, butter and ghee, different types of cheeses (fresh to semi-hard), ice cream and sweet porridges. For a sustainable milk processing business investments in a plant with equipment are inescapable, but running it profitable decisions need to be made regularly based on correct financial calculations, risk management, organisation and communication."

After this choice has been made a dairy farmer should be able to determine which breeding policy to apply; selection of the best cows within his/ her herd and breeding bulls using the right selection criteria, using latest technologies (cross breeding, genomic selection, use of sexed semen, etc.). Once breeding policy has been determined animals have to be monitored for heat signs, choices have to be made on optimum insemination time, etc. Also in this process new technologies are coming up very fast/ management insights have changed during the last years. Once the cow has been inseminated it should be monitored and it should be checked for pregnancy. For pregnancy diagnosis new technologies are coming up fast which will help the farmer a lot in monitoring his herd and fertility management. This will require a lot of herd administration which will result in the calculation of key fertility performance indicators which need interpretation, analysis and action."

Also young stock rearing systems determine to a large extend the quality of the dairy cow on the farm. Feeding costs usually make up often over fifty % of the variable costs on a commercial dairy farm. That is why production of good quality and enough quantity of roughage in combination with proper feeding management is the foundation for optimal technical and financial results on commercial dairy farms all over the world. During this course participants will learn how to optimize their fodder production, storage and conservation, feeding of dairy cattle and young stock rearing management taking into consideration as much as possible the conditions in which the participants have to work at home. Attention will also be given to calculation and interpretation of fodder production and feeding management performance indicators in order to monitor fodder production and feeding management including greenhouse gas emissions."

It comprises of 3 modules focusing on forage production, nutrition, breeding, reproduction management, housing and farm economics The objective of all commercial dairy farmers is to make a profit. The costs and quantities of inputs in combination with the technical results achieved and the output (milk) prices determine whether a dairy farm is commercially viable and therefore sustainable. Ensuring the production of sufficient quantity and quality of roughages, their preservation and usage in feeding dairy animals are essential. Fodder and feed is supplied according to requirements and used in the optimum way. Breeding and reproduction management are important in order to produce replacement animals of better quality. Getting insight with regard to housing and mechanisation of dairy farms which have their impact on labour efficiency, costs, animal welfare, environment. To monitor and evaluate the technical performance recording and analysis of all farm data will be important in order to make informed decisions. All of the above aspects also have their impact on technical and the financial performance of the dairy farm. As an entrepreneur you are also continuously looking for ideas to improve the technical and financial performance of your farm. This will require preparing business plans"

Poultry development inevitably leads to market-oriented enterprises. These enterprises aim to maximise income which can be achieved by technical and economical efficient production. Analysis of the achieved results is important in order to recognise where improvements can be made and whether or not certain investments will be feasible. A proper “business plan” should be available. Health problems can seriously affect the profitability of the enterprise, so much attention is paid for preventive health programmes. Efficient production in itself is no guarantee for success of an enterprise. There should be a certain number of potential consumers with enough purchasing power willing to buy the products (marketing plan)."
