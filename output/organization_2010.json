Learn to design your result-oriented programme. It's all about achieving Results… Although it sounds very logical and obvious to manage for results, reality is often different. In the last couple of years the concept of Results-Based Management (RBM) has gained influence in the development cooperation sector. However, what does Results-Based Management really mean. How do we define Results? What are the tools, techniques and consequences for Planning and Monitoring? This course will offer you conventional and new tools to plan and monitor your projects and programmes in a participatory and results-oriented manner. PARTICIPANTS You are a staff member of a development organisation involved in managing projects, or a project or programme officer, community development worker, facilitator or consultant in need of mastering RBM concepts and tools while managing projects. You have the wish to strengthen your RBM approach in a practical manner. The starting point is that all tools are participatory by nature, meaning involving stakeholders, with an ultimate focus on results rather than activities. Your own case will serve as the basis for learning and change"

You will be equipped with combined strategies, useful insights, tools and skills. Advocacy and Policy Influencing is crucial to achieve lasting change. This is why an increasing amount of actors (civil society organisations, state actors, international organisations and business) engage in policy influencing. However, it is a challenge to truly effect change through policy influencing. Often initiatives concentrate on changing policies and laws and hardly on changing practice and behaviour through effective implementation of such policies and laws. Participants You are a programme officer working in development cooperation or human rights and part of your work is to influence policies. You are a manager or lobbyist/advocate and working for a civil society organisation, a governmental body or an international institution. Course Objectives Get to know the Policy Influencing Cycle Identify relevant issues for Policy influencing and Advocacy Analyse the policy environment and choose effective strategies and tactics for policy influencing with your beneficiaries and stakeholders Know how to influence decision makers Reinforce your influencing attitude and practice skills Prepare policy change goals with different stakeholder settings"
